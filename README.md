# Prediction-Model

**Project Overview**  
During my one-month internship with Rakamin, in collaboration with ID/X Partners, I worked in the field of data science, successfully completing all tasks on time. This experience allowed me to apply data-driven techniques in real-world scenarios.

**Technologies and Tools Utilized**  
The project primarily used Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and SciPy for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

**Skills Gained**  
Throughout the internship, I applied and enhanced my skills in Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and Machine Learning to solve practical problems and deliver impactful results.
